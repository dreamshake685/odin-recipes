<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bruschetta (pronouced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or
    grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so
    each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large
    enough for one or two bites.</p>
