<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Koko alaisa is a heart warming dish and is considered a staple
    in Samoa, and in Samoan communities all over the globe. In essence,
    it is chocolate rice, and is deliciously simple and yes, it is
    comfort food territory. One of the best things about Samoa is some 
    of the simple Samoan food that just tastes so darn good.
</p>
<p>Many Samoans think fondly back to their childhoods where koko alaisa
    would be served at family gatherings. In fact, for Samoans reading
    this, you might almost be able to smell the scent of koko and 
    fresh bread in the pacific island air right now.
